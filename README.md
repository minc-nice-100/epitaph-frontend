## 🕯️ Remembrance

My father passed unexpectedly on 2024/12/20. We have chosen not to perform autopsy; the likely cause of death was mechanical asphyxia due to choking. He was only 52 years old. His life ended too soon — but the love, memories, and warmth he gave will never fade.

Just a day before he left us, he received the pre-admission notice to my dream school. He was truly happy then. I will carry that joy, along with his hopes and love, as I continue walking forward in life.

We later retrieved his phone. Scrolling through the expenses, we noticed: aside from registration fees and our pocket money, he barely spent anything on himself. Not a single transaction over 50 RMB for himself. As a father, as the pillar of our family, he gave everything selflessly. We will carry that love in our hearts — supporting one another, as he wished.

May love and memory live on.
